# Waver

A game created for the global game jam, 2017 - http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/waver

----

Small puzzle game, poorly written using Haskell and Helm.

Hold the space bar to move. When you release, you will rotate anti-clockwise. If you hit a clockwise spiral, you will begin to move clockwise when you release the space bar. If you hit an anti-clockwise spiral, you will begin to move anti-clockwise when you release the space bar.

Consists of three demo levels.

There's a small built in hack of a level editor, which can cause the game to crash if used incorrectly.

Linux only, but could easily be ported to Windows or macOS.
